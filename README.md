# Henry Wyeth
## Junior Software Developer | London, UK


### Work
Iâ€™m currently working as a self-employed musician as part of the band Amber Run. That career offers me a great level of free time, which is why I'm looking to start a new career in another passion of mine: Software Development.

### Education
At present I am learning Python with HyperionDev and CoGrammar as part of the Software Engineer bootcamp. I also have a BA in Ancient History from the University of Nottingham.

### Interests
I'm particularly interested in the role software plays in helping us better understand data especially in the world of sports, and video game development.

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to get in touch.
