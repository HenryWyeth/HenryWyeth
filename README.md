# Henry Wyeth
## Junior Software Developer
### London, UK

### Work
Iâ€™m currently working as a self-employed musician as part of the band Amber Run. That career offers me a great level of free time, which is why I'm looking to start a new career in another passion of mine: Software Development.

### Education
Iâ€™m currently learning Python with HyperionDev and CoGrammar as part of the Software Engineer bootcamp. I also have a BA in Ancient History from the University of Nottingham.
